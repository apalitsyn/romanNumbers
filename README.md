# Getting Started

There are two parts to the app, the backend and frontend.

## Backend 
Acts as an API endpoint and is built in Node.js. Can be ran as a standalone server and you will be able to see conversion result in your browser or terminal. 

*Instructions are inside backend/README.md*

## Frontend 
The frontend application built on Next.js. **It requires the Backend application to be running, as it is used as an API endpoint**.
